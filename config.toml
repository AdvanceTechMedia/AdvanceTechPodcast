			bio = "CEO and Founder of Adaptech Solutions, and co-host of the Advance Tech Podcast, Adam is a passionate technologist and has worked in the field for a few decades in numerous roles. He has contributed to the scaling approaches in CQRS and Event Sourcing by introducing PAXOS to the consistency strategy in 2008. In 2011-2012, he helped Microsoft's Patterns and Practices team introduce modern open-source tooling to the CQRS Journey book project. He has inspired organisations to excel in approaches to software in modern workflows, inspired a culture of learning and instilled a modern approach to software architecture. A subscriber to the idea that Conway’s Law is something that can be taken advantage of instead of something organisations fall victim to, he is able to put the right teams together, using the right future-proof technologies to get software written with the highest quality at lower costs and timelines."
