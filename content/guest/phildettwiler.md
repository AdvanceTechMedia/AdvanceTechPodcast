Phil’s role at SEBA combines a deep understanding of banking as a business process and a strategic perspective gained at the forefront of Switzerland’s crypto evolution. Over 15 years of operational experience gained at Switzerland’s largest banks has prepared him for the task of helping to build Switzerland’s first universal crypto bank. His time in Asia coupled with large-scale project success stories, first-class qualifications from the universities of St. Gallen, Lausanne, Berne and Rochestor allow him a founded perspective on the future of banking.
In his private life, he loves to swap his shirt for a harness or helmet to indulge in kitesurfing and mountain biking.
