Magus is a recent computer science and entrepreneurship graduate from East Carolina University and is part of Project Owl - the winning team from the first Call for Code Hackathon.

While in school, wanting to do more than just go to class, he worked in teams on multiple side projects and competitions, some even leading to compete on the global level.

His interest in tech, art, and civic engagement and past success of working in teams, led him to found and lead multiple interdisciplinary initiatives. Some of them include: EPIC (Empowering Pioneers through Innovative Culture) - entrepreneurship organization; PitchDark â€“ monthly pitching series, and Spark - multidisciplinary makeathon to advocate STEAM.

Currently, he proudly works at IBM, and aspires to continue working and building products that can create lasting social impacts globally.
