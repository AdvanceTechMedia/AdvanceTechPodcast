Samson Mow is Blockstream's CSO and Pixelmatic's CEO. Blockstream is the leading provider of blockchain technologies, on the forefront of work in cryptography and distributed systems. Samson founded Pixelmatic in 2011 to create engaging games that are truly social and encourage new connections to be made.

Previously at BTCC, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges and mining pools in the world, Samson's role as COO was to oversee the day-to-day operations of the company and directly manage the exchange and mining pool business units. 

Previously, Samson was a director of production and executive producer at Ubisoft, where he spearheaded expansion into Asian markets for web, social, and mobile games. Samson oversaw ongoing development and live operations of the cross-platform (web and iOS) MMO strategy game "Might & Magic: Heroes Kingdoms" in Asia, along with the social games "Castle & Co" (Facebook, mixi, Naver) and "The Smurfs & Co" (Facebook, mixi). "The Smurfs & Co" is Ubisoftâ€™s most successful social game to date, reaching over 10 million users through organic growth. 

Prior to Ubisoft, Samson was in charge of business development and operations at Sitemasher, a Vancouver based startup developing a SaaS platform for building websites and apps. Sitemasher was the winner of the 2008 Blue Sky Innovation Excellence Award from Microsoft and was later acquired by Salesforce.com for US$20 million and rebranded as Site.com.

Samson holds a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Simon Fraser University in Canada. As a veteran of the game industry, Samson regularly features as a speaker and panelist in conferences such as GDC and CGDC.
