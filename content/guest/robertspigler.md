Robert is a voluntaryist and crypto-anarchist, who believes in free/libre and open source software and hardware.  He is an early Bitcoin maximalist, an avid learner, and also interested in music, logic, and meta-ethics.  As an Operations and Information Security self-teacher, he enjoys analyzing systems and protocols for security vulnerabilities and improvements.  He started the collaboration and fundraising efforts to port Qubes to the Power ISA.  Currently, as a Co-founder of YetiCold, Robert is working on secure, offline, HD multisig wallets, and writing clear documentation for people of all technical levels.  His biggest challenge is not falling into the trap of security nihilism.
