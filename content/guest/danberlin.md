Co-founder and CEO of Rodelle, a world leading vanilla extract company, Dan grew up in the chocolate town of Hershey, Pennsylvania and now lives in Fort Collins,Colorado with his wife and two children.  Over the course of twenty years, Dan gradually lost his eyesight from cone-rod dystrophy. He struggled with the limitations of his new reality, but instead of simply feeling sorry for himself, he came up with a new way to approach the rest of his life.

â€‹He decided, despite his blindness, to become a marathoner.  Dan has since run twelve marathons, including NYC and Boston, completed several triathlons, was the first blind athlete to run across the Grand Canyon and back, ran the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in less than 13 hours, and recently completed his greatest challenge to date: climbing to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro in two and a half days.
