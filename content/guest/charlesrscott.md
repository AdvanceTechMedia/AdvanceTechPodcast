Mixing in anecdotes from cycling over 7,000 miles with his young children across Japan, Iceland, Europe and the U.S., and from guiding the first blind runner to cross the Grand Canyon and back nonstop, he describes how to use discomfort to your advantage, encourage informed risk taking, and share the secret to optimal performance.

He has given talks at AT&T, Intel Corporation, The World Bank, Harvard Business School, Yale School of Management, Vistage International CEO groups, Celebrity Cruise Lines, U.S. Pharmacopeia, Bayer and many conferences and events.

Author of "Rising Son: A Father and Son's Bike Adventure Across Japan," his writings have been published by CNBC, National Geographic's Intelligent Travel blog, the Huffington Post, the United Nations and others. Kinokuniya, the largest bookstore chain in Japan, published a Japanese translation of "Rising Son" in December 2014.

In October 2014, he guided the first blind runner to cross the Grand Canyon and back nonstop, covering 46 miles "rim to rim to rim." In October 2015, he guided the first blind runner to ascend the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu nonstop. These feats and the family adventures with his two young children across Japan, Iceland, Europe and the U.S. have been featured in The New York Times, Outside Magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and on TV shows, radio programs, magazines and newspapers around the world.
