Charles R. Scott left a 14-year career at Intel Corporation to found the Family Adventure Guy.  A National Geographic-featured adventurer and author of the book Rising Son: A Father and Son’s Bike Adventure Across Japan, he takes his two young children on endurance challenges around the world linked to charitable causes.

​He and his children have cycled over 7,000 miles, including the length of Japan, the circumference of Iceland, across Western Europe and over the Rocky Mountains while following the Lewis & Clark Trail in the U.S.  He ran his first marathon at age 13, has completed six Ironman triathlons, and guided Dan in four marathons and a Half Ironman.
