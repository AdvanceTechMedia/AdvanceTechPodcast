Ivan has broad research interests that usually touch on systems and software engineering. His current projects span distributed systems, formal methods, networks, and security. He enjoys building and studying real software systems and tends to be empirical in his research.

He started at UBC in the Summer of 2013. Before this he was working on his [PhD](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/theses/ivan_beschastnikh_thesis.pdf) at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle. At UW he worked with [Tom Anderson](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom/), [Michael Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/), and [Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind) on tools to infer models of complex systems from logs of their behavior, networked testbeds, DHTs, and other fun topics.
