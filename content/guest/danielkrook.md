He was a catalyst behind Call for Code, a five-year initiative that inspires developers to create sustainable software solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As CTO, he ensures that those ideas are delivered where they can make the greatest impact through the IBM Code and Response Initiative.

He has been recognized as an IBM and The Open Group Distinguished Technical Specialist, Senior Technical Staff Member, Master Inventor, Member of the IBM Academy of Technology, and Best of IBM Honoree.

Prior to his work in cloud computing, Mr. Krook led global teams to develop enterprise web and desktop applications according to his architectural guidance and project plans. Before that, he built the News Room and Investor Relations sites that IBM used for official public communications.

Daniel has engineered software end-to-end for a wide array of industries and earned certifications in cloud architecture, application development, and system operations along the way.

He's filed dozens of patent applications, spoken at many conferences, and often written for IBM blogs, developerWorks, and Redbooks. He's organized New York Cloud Foundry, OpenStack, and PHP meetups for a number of years.

Mr. Krook graduated from Trinity College (Hartford, CT) with a double major in Political Science and International Studies. He studied abroad in Cuba and South Africa, holds dual USA-Finland/EU citizenship, and has collaborated with professional colleagues throughout the world.
