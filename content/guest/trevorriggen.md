Trevor Riggen has been with the Red Cross for more than nine years. He most recently served as the Vice President of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the national organization where he was responsible for planning, implementing and managing scalable relief operations to meet the direct needs of disaster clients for all domestic events. In this role he was directly accountable for leading successful response and recovery efforts to major disasters, including Superstorm Sandy and the 2013 Oklahoma Tornadoes.

Trevor oversees the Red Cross services in the Northern California Coastal Region, which is comprised of the Bay Area, California Northwest, Central Coast and Silicon Valley Chapters. He leads a team of more than 6,000 volunteers and 70 employees, who respond to nearly 800 local disasters each year and serve the more than eight million residents in the 16-county region with lifesaving programs.

Prior to coming to Red Cross, Trevor has held a number of leadership positions with community-based organizations in both Illinois and the Washington, DC metro area focused on literacy, crime prevention, poverty reduction, education and emergency planning for public school districts. He served in the Peace Corps in Morocco where he developed local agricultural cooperatives. He earned his B.S. in Political Science from the University of Illinois and a Masters in Public Policy and Nonprofit Management from Georgetown University.
