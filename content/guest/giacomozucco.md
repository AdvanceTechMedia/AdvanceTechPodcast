Giacomo is from Milan, was born in 1983 and holds a degree in Physics from the University of Milan. In 2013 he left the multinational Accenture, where I worked for four years as a Technology Consultant, to launch myself with some innovative ideas on the Italian scene of technological start-ups ... before realizing that the first rule of a start-up (or any other business activity) is "valla to realize  far from the Italian fiscal hell ". Passionate about political theory, "paleo-libertarian" convinced and "Austrian" for economic reasons, in July 2010 I joined the global anti-tax movement known as "Tea Party" , becoming its spokespersonin Italy. In this capacity I participated in conferences, seminars, demonstrations and numerous TV debates on national networks. Currently I spend a large part of my efforts in the study and dissemination of Bitcoin technology : I apply it as an instrument of freedom and overcoming geographical barriers as a partner of the WMOGroup internationalization  company , I study the ecosystem at the technological level as Project Director BlockchainLab , I contribute to develop it as Head of Business Development of the GreenAddress start-up , help entrepreneurs and professionals to exploit its business potential as Partner of the CoinCapital consulting firm, I organize representation, advocacy and institutional relations as Founding Member and Vice-President of the "category" association AssoB.IT . I have written and written articles on politics, economics and technological innovation for online and offline periodicals such as Il Fatto Quotidiano , Lamiafinanza, Il Foglio, Liber @ mente, Strade, L'Entraprendente and others. Since February 2010 I am happily married to a beautiful singing teacher. I'm passionate about cinema, TV series, comics, video games, martial arts ... I mean, I'm a nerd.
