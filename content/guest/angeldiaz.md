Always on the move, Dr. Angel Diaz is IBM’s Vice President of Developer Technology, Open Source & Advocacy. His passion is to leverage technology to drive positive change. Specifically to empower developers to solve the world’s problems – smarter, faster, together – all in the open source world. Prior to this role, as IBM’s VP of Cloud Technology and Architecture, Angel and his team were responsible for the technology, architecture and strategy behind IBM’s Hybrid, open and secure cloud – empowering our clients with a new way to work.

When he’s not working to bring greater value to clients through a flexible & interoperable cloud, he’s IBM’s leader for open technology where he is spearheading an industry IT renaissance driven by open source code, community and culture. A master of the art-of- the-possible, Dr. Diaz has been the driving force behind many of the most important Cloud, Data and Mobile open technology industry movements – all focused on enabling innovation that is built on simple, practical solutions.

With a career rooted in IBM Research, building the standards upon which the web runs, and having successfully lead both business & development teams at IBM, Dr. Diaz has a unique perspective on technology’s effect on today’s opportunities. In those rare moments of stillness, you might find Dr. Diaz vanquishing his foes across Azeroth, or forging amazing new worlds in Minecraft with his daughter.
