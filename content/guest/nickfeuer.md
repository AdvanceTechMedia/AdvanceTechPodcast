Nick Feuer is a Software Developer with a background in cancer research and is part of Project Owl - the winning team from the first Call for Code Hackathon. He is not only an active participant in hackathons, but has also played roles in organizing hackathons such as Fishackathon and Space Apps. As the NYC Ambassador for AngelHack, he helps produce hackathons as well as grow the hacker community in NYC.

He started out working as a lab technician in cancer research labs, but after realizing the limitations of innovation in the field, he switched his studies to Mathematics & Computer Science. Drawn to the flexibility of technology to be applied to complex problems in many fields, he started participating in numerous hackathons around the world. He joined the Project OWL team for the Call for Code Global Challenge as the lead on using LoRa and networking strategies for their IoT devices. He worked previously as a Backend Developer for IDT Corporation, and is now working on Project OWL full-time.
