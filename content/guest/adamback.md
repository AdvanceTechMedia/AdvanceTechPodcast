Adam Back is an Applied Cryptographer, the Inventor of Hashcash and a Cypherpunk. He holds a Computer Science PhD in Distributed Systems from the University of Exeter and is co-founder and CEO of Blockstream.

In 1997, he invented hashcash originally as a general proof-of-work system with applications for anti-DoS via the creation of computationally expensive to create but fast to verify electronic stamps. Applications included deterring anonymous remailer DoS, email spam, blog spam, pseudonym name-squatting etc. Hashcash was proposed for mining by pre-bitcoin ecash systems b-money in 1998 by Wei Dai, bit-gold in 1998 by Nick Szabo and RPOW in 2005 by Hal Finney and later Bitcoin in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.

He has an interest in privacy enhancing technology, electronic cash.

Adam believes that positive change in the world is achieved by deploying disruptive technologies, that shift the balance of power to the individual, like PGP, Tor, bittorrent, Bitcoin.
