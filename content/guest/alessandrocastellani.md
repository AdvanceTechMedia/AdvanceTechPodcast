#### This is my past
I fell in love with computers when I was 7, now I’m an adult and I still love Pokemon… but this is another story! I’m a passionate Designer, a meticulous Developer, and an unstoppable Dreamer (now you know why my site has three d’s at the end *sigh of wonder*). I’m always looking on the bright side of life, I love to learn new things every day, and, if you want to make me happy, create a challenge for me.

I consider myself a uniquely skilled production machine and my ability to fit perfectly in a huge team or to be able to cover the entire production workflow of pretty much any digital product confirms this title. I don’t want to sound too cocky, but my skills and my experiences talk for myself.

I started drawing in preschool, watching my father paint, and I wanted to create my own comic book. After attending a not-so-satisfying art school, I discovered the wonderful and exciting world of coding. I was so into programming, that I decided to code my own RPG play by chat in one night, just to learn PHP… and I did it.

I attended the European Institute of Design while working in pretty much every field with “digital” written in it. Graphic Designer, Video Editor, 3D Modeler, Sound Designer, Web Developer, and even Teacher of Visual Arts. During those years I experienced a multitude of environments, improving my skills, learning, and increasing my knowledge.

#### This is my present
Other than working non-stop, I like to create native Linux Applications like Sequeler, Taxi, and Akira, and release Tutorials about Design and Development on YouTube.

During the little free time I have left, I love to entertain myself with different, and absolutely unrelated, activities, like drawing my own comics, playing my guitar, riding my Harley, and keeping my body in good shape with Kung Fu.
