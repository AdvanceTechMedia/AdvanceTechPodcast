After graduating from the grueling tutelage of Prof. Ruben Somsen at the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup, Mario ended his previous career as a teacher and went on to work on Bitcoin things at Blockstream, where he does the non-engineery stuff so that the engineers can keep doing their stuff. He also likes rationality, psychedelics, meditation, environmentalism, capitalism, and effective altruism.
