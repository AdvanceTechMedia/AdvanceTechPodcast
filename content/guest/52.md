Before entering the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole Cypherpunk Now did graphic design for two decades. After a few years spending bitcoin on coffee and creating the visual face of the Paraleln√≠ Polis project, co-founded with the Ztohoven group in 2014 he found himself at the center of Bitcoin's maximalists in 2020. Making the graphic design of printed Citadel21 zines, he gets inspiration for sketches, paintings, collages that he creates and prints in limited editions on screen print.
