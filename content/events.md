<h3> Magical Crypto Conference </h3>

The [**Magical Crypto Conference**](https://magicalcryptoconference.com/) is a collaboration between Charlie Lee, Samson Mow, Riccardo Spagni and WhalePanda aka the Magical Crypto Friends. In October 2017 they came up with the idea of doing a podcast together which turned out to be a big success. Every month since then they've released a podcast which is an interesting combination of news, technical issues explained in a way that everyone can understand it and humour. In May 2018 the 4 friends all went to Consensus. After the initial shock of seeing so little technical content and so many scammy ICOs they came up with the idea of doing Magical Crypto Conference: an affordable, content-driven conference aimed at both technical and less-technical people.
