<h3 class="grid_episode_title">Advance Tech Social</h3>

The **Advance Tech Social** event connects Founders, Investors, the C-Suite and a group of like-minded technologists, disruptors and innovators, who are committed to pushing the boundaries and advancing bleeding edge tech, thinking and product.

We meet on a monthly basis topics range from bleeding edge tech (AI, crypto, blockchain, quantum computing, nanotechnology) to entrepreneurship, community and practices changing the world.

If you want to advance technology or would like to learn how to advance how we work, this is the social for you to meet the people you need in your life!
