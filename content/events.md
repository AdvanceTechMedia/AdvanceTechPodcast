<h3 class="grid_episode_title">Advance Tech Social</h3>

The **Advance Tech Social** event connects Founders, Investors, the C-Suite and a group of like-minded technologists, disruptors and innovators, who are committed to pushing the boundaries and advancing bleeding edge tech, thinking and product.

We meet on a monthly basis and topics range from bleeding edge tech (AI, crypto, blockchain, quantum computing, nanotechnology) to entrepreneurship, community and practices changing the world.

If you want to advance technology or the way you approach work - this is the social for you!
