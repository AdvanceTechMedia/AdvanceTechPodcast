**[Peer.Social](https://peer.social/)** is a group of dedicated decentralists researching and developing new architectures and new technologies to solve some of the most pressing problems of our time, starting with social media.  Decentralisation is key to restoring the balance of power on the Internet by giving back ownership of their own data to users, empowering them with the freedom of human-to-human connections without Big Brother spying on them.  Our first project is a decentralised, peer-to-peer, encrypted, personally-managed social network.
