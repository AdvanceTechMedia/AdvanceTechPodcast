Written by Alexandra Moxin

Peter-Paul Van Hoeken is Founder and CEO of FrontFundr, The New Capital Market, Canadaâ€™s leading online funding and investment platform connecting private companies to the investor community.  Peter-Paul has over 15 years of experience in banking in Europe. After moving to Canada in 2010, he worked with several young companies and realized that there are no efficient channels for attracting capital and that most investors are locked out from investing in private companies. In 2013 Peter-Paul founded FrontFundr to connect companies with the wider investor community by using technology.

FrontFundr is the leading online funding and investment platform in Canada with a proven track record of successfully completing the first equity crowdfunding transactions in Canada. FrontFundr advocates an open and transparent market in which companies and investors understand the risks and potential returns (or losses). FrontFundr has developed a secure proprietary technology platform, and has strong relationships with all stakeholders including the provincial securities regulators in Canada, as a fully registered Exempt Market Dealer in eight provinces.

Peter-Paul also serves as a director on the National Board of the Private Capital Markets Association in Canada and as an advisor to the National Crowdfunding Association Canada.
