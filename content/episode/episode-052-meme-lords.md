Written by Alexandra Moxin

This episode features Yellow, Greg Zaj, and RD the Chief Meme Lords (Chief Meme Officers) recently hired at Strike. Yellow created the character Yellow and pop cat and all three (of nine) are behind the #LaserRayUntil100K phenomenon on Twitter.

We discuss origin stories, Bitcoin Twitter, surviving bull markets and discovering the true value of bitcoin, the “Office” style banter, how they connected with Jack Mallers, CEO and Founder of Strike, and who is responsible for laser eyes appearing all over Twitter including Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, and Cynthia Lummis.

We talk about each creator's popular memes that gained traction including the videogame video meme of the character Yellow, RD's Elon Musk/Lion King meme and poking fun at one another while honing their craft #SorryNotSorry.

Yellow explains how the character Yellow came into existence. RD talks about how he and Yellow met after he created the pop cat #HaveFunStayingPoor meme. I ask each guest their thoughts on what is Bitcoin Twitter and Yellow provides more insight about pop cat.
