In this episode I spend some time with Dr. Angel Diaz, Vice President of Developer Technology, Open Source & Advocacy at IBM, and Bryan Knouse and Nick Feuer from Project OWL the winning team of the Call for Code hackathon.

Before getting into Call for Code I ask Dr. Diaz about his background which includes working with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), on some of the original web standards and technologies.

We also discuss the benefits of open source along with some of Dr. Diaz's favourite open source initiatives at IBM.
