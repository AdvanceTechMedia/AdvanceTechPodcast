Written by Alexandra Moxin

This episode is part two with Smuggler and Frank Braun live from the 7th Annual Hackers Congress: Digital Totality at Paralelni Polis in Prague, CZ. Both guests are cryptoanarchists, software developers and advocates for privacy. They co-founded TAZ0 and co-host the Cypherpunk Bitstream Podcast.

In this episode we cover privacy in depth and what steps you can take to protect your privacy. We dig into the talks each gave at HCPP and discuss dark markets, logistics, infiltration vectors, the power of memes, and fallacies and misconceptions such as 'just use TOR'. 

Smuggler and Braun explain some of the issues with using the TOR Network for regular internet use, including requirements of anti-DDOS companies, vulnerability to sibling attacks, and a lack of monetization/legal strategy for nodes. They also compare and contrast Tor and the Nym Project.

We also discuss open hardware, edge networks and much more.
