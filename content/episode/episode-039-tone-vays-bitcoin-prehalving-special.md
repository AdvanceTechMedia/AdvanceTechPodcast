Tone Vays joins me on a special pre-halving episode of the Advance Tech Podcast. Tone talks about his pre-bitcoin days and how he got into bitcoin. We dig into the recent channel ban he experienced on YouTube, the dispute process and his recommendations for content creators currently facing this. 

We touch on free speech and why it matters, the American Constitution and the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

Tone organized and hosted Unconfiscatable, the last major Bitcoin conference in 2020, just prior to the global lockdown. We speak about Unconfiscatable, virtual events, his upcoming Halving Livestream on May 11th,  Understanding Bitcoin and the upcoming Financial Summit in November.

Closing out the episode I ask Tone his price predictions for Bitcoin going into the halving and the fundamentals that make Bitcoin a strong asset to hold.
