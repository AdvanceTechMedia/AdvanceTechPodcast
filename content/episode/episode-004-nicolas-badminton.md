**“The exponential growth of humanity is happening today. And, we have the power to define that through love and wisdom.” – Nikolas Badminton, Futurist**

[Nikolas Badminton](@nikolasfuturist) is a researcher and futurist speaker who splits his time between Canada (Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal), USA, UK, and provides insights into how people, communities, cities, businesses, and countries are changing with exponential technology.

He studied Applied Psychology and Computing in the U.K. and specialised in artificial intelligence and linguistics along with social network theory and human-computer interaction. For over 20 years he's been hacking his way through tech jobs in big data, analytics, advertising, and the sharing economy.

He recently interviewed Edward Snowden at the University of Waterloo, spoke to 1500 leaders at the Premier's Forum for Natural Resources in Prince George and you can see him at these upcoming events: Canada Futurists in Vancouver and Toronto, Our Futures Conference at Quest University in Squamish, and the 18th Annual Privacy & Security Conference leading a panel about Mixed Reality with innovators in that field.

You can see some of Nik's featured work and speaking engagements at [Nikolas Badminton.com](http://nikolasbadminton.com/) and be sure to check him out at Exponential Minds which is a content and event network and a worldwide superinfluencers network and the [Futurists Speakers Agency](www.futuristspeakersagency.com).
