Written by Alexandra Moxin

This episode with Dan Berlin and Charles R. Scott from Team See Possibilities is one of the most powerful episodes I've had the pleasure to record. It encourages you to challenge your beliefs and perceived obstacles by telling the story of one man's strength and perseverance.

Dan Berlin was diagnosed with Cone Rod Dystrophy at a young age. He was legally blind in his late twenties and fully blind by age _____. Dan refused to accept the traditionally limiting hand fate had dealt him and is currently, with his team of 3 guides, midway through completing 7 major endurance challenges on 7 continents.

Starting with Charles' background at Intel I ask how he made the transition to becoming a speaker and adventurer and led to the two books he wrote which are dedicated to each of his children. Charles gives some practical tips on finding and exploring your passion.

Listen in to hear the story how Dan uses technology to enhance his training and his life and what Dan, Charles and their team are achieving with Team See Possibilities and how you can contribute to their non-profit.

 Hope you enjoy listening to this episode as much as I enjoyed making it!
