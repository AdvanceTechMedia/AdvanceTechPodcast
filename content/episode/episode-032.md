This episode with Dan Berlin and Charles R. Scott from Team See Possibilities is one of the most powerful episodes I've had the pleasure to record. It encourages you to challenge your belief of what at first seems like an obstacle by telling the story of one man's strength and perseverance.

Dan Berlin was diagnosed with ________ at a young age. He was legally blind in his early twenties and fully blind by age _____. Dan refused to accept the traditionally limiting hand fate had dealt him and instead chose to lead by example. Dan, with his team of 3 guides, is midway through completing 7 major endurance challenges on 7 continents.

 Charles and Dan tell Dan's story in this inspiring episode. From ____ to how Dan uses technology to assist, _____ and how you can contribute to their non-profit.

 Hope you enjoy listening to this episode as much as I enjoyed recording it!
