Written by Alexandra Moxin

This episode with Dan Berlin and Charles R. Scott from Team See Possibilities is one of the most powerful and inspiring episodes I've had the pleasure to record. It encourages you to challenge your beliefs and perceived obstacles by telling the story of one man's perseverance and strength.

Dan Berlin was diagnosed with cone-rod dystrophy at a young age. He was legally blind in his late twenties and fully blind before he turned 40. Dan refused to accept the limiting hand fate had dealt him and is currently, with his team of 3 guides, midway through completing 7 major endurance challenges on 7 continents.

Starting with Charles' background at Intel I ask how he made the transition to becoming a speaker and adventurer and how that story led to the two books he wrote which are dedicated to each of his children. Charles also gives some practical tips on finding and exploring your passion. Then hear Dan's story and how he uses technology to enhance his training and his life. Dan and Charles talk about what they're achieving with Team See Possibilities, past and future adventures and how you can contribute to their non-profit.

Closing out the episode Dan challenges listeners to look into hiring or working with a person with a visual disability or who is vision-impaired and Charles asks listeners to explore and challenge your perceived limits. Finally, Charles talks about his two books Rising Son and Daunted Courage and the journey behind each of these.

 Hope you enjoy this powerful and inspiring episode!
