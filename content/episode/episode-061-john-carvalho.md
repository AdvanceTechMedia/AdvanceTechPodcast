This episode features John Carvalho, CEO of Synonym, a company using Bitcoin and new protocol, Slashtags, to reboot the web & economy.

We discuss:

* 01:33 What is Synonym looking to achieve and accomplish?
* 04:31 What were the highlights from the panel at Adopting Bitcoin 2021?
* 07:36 What seems most promising and what is currently lacking in the Lightning Network?
* 12:43 Products and projects in this space that are doing a good job of communicating, design, and UX.
* 14:49 Interesting projects and developments in the free and open source space.
* 16:38 What might the Lightning network look like in 2030?
* 20:48 Johnâ€™s new podcast, The Biz

John's question to the audience is around which narratives in this space resonate & make sense, and which don't. You can find John as @BitcoinErrorLog on most channels.
