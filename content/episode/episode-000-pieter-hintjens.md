In this special edition memorial episode Adam interviews Pieter Hintjens. Pieter was a published author, an expert in distributed computing, a passionate supporter of free software and a very dear friend.

Pieter pioneered the concepts of [Social Architecture](http://hintjens.com/blog:_community) and [Living Systems](http://hintjens.com/blog:74) and spent decades building large software systems and on-line communities. He founded the ZeroMQ free software project (2007) and the edgenet project (2013) with the goal of building a fully secure, anonymous peer-to-peer Internet. An accomplished architect and developer Pieter wrote over 30 protocols and distributed software systems.

Pieter authored several books including "ZeroMQ - Messaging for Many Applications" (O'Reilly), "Code Connected", "Culture and Empire: Digital Revolution" and "The Psychopath Code". Sadly, Pieter passed before completing his last book "Scalable C" but we've included links to Pieter's original writing and a current version being maintained by the booksbyus organization below.

Through his company, iMatix, Pieter provided support to the ZeroMQ market, and in this role traveled the world teaching, coaching and helping others to organize successfully. A strong critic of the patent system, Pieter led the European effort to ban software patents from 2005 to 2007. 

Pieter was one of those rare souls who made the world a better, more open place. If you enjoyed this episode, please consider [donating](https://www.paypal.me/Hintjens) to Pieter's family and legacy.
