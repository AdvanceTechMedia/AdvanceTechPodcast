Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I visit SEBA Bank AG and speak with Phil Dettwiler, Head of Custody Storage and Transaction Banking. SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss bank providing a seamless, secure and easy-to-use bridge between digital and traditional assets. Phil’s role at SEBA combines a deep understanding of banking as a business process and a strategic perspective gained at the forefront of Switzerland’s crypto evolution.
 
 We speak about the liquidity, volatility and current infrastructure of the digital asset and securities market, traditional vs. digital tokens, valuation of the digital asset space and why the market is ready for institutional investors. We touch on the regulation of digital assets and why the power consumption involved in securing Bitcoin is not such a big issue.
 
We talk about the degree of how tainted are cash vs. cryptocurrencies in grey markets and Phil explains SEBA's custom tooling regarding KYC, AML and how they assess various digital assets. In addition, SEBA offers a not for profit division aimed at increasing knowledge of the digital asset space. Phil explains how SEBA addresses security, accessibility and convenience in their custodial banking and storage solutions aimed at institutional investors and traders.
 
 Closing out the episode Phil asks listeners what else is left to be taken care of and what additional concerns SEBA Bank AG could address for institutional clients. You can reach Phil via [email](mailto:phil.dettwiler@seba.swiss), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Phil_Det) or on [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-e-dettwiler-b590883/).
