Quote??

In this episode I interview JW Weatherman, bitcoin core developer and security consultant, his son Will, and Robert Spigler, crypto-anarchist, FLOSS/H enthusiast and bitcoin maximalist. We spend the first 20 minutes digging into Yeti's development and features including Yeti Hot, Yeti Warm and Yeti Cold. We talk about good security practices and compare the features available natively in Yeti against hardware wallets including Ledger, Tresor and ColdCard.

We discuss why it's important to run a full node and all the benefits of using Bitcoin Core beyond the fact that it's by far the most peer reviewed software project in this space.
