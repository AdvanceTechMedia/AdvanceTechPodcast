Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode Mario Gibney Team Lead at Blockstream and Co-host of the Unhashed Podcast joins me to interview bitcoiner Karo Zagorus. 

We discuss Karo's recent graduate thesis Bitcoin and the Trust Problem: Is Bitcoin adoption accelerated by the abuse of trust? which "Examine[s] how our trust is being breached and abused, how we are used for rent-seeking, how governments impoverish us through the use of Monetary Nationalism and examining whether Bitcoin is the solution to restore individual freedom and limit the reach of government."
