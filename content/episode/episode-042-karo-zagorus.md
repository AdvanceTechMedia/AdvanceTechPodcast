"Once we see hyperbitcoinization, we will see more and more bitcoiners wielding riches they acquired through virtue, mental strength and determination." Karo Zagorus, in Reputation: the Bitcoiner's Minefield. Citadel 21, Vol.1. April 2020.

In this episode Mario Gibney Customer Support Team Lead at Blockstream and co-host of the Unhashed Podcast joins me to interview Bitcoiner Karo Zagorus. 

We discuss Karo's recent graduate thesis: Bitcoin and the Trust Problem: Is Bitcoin adoption accelerated by the abuse of trust? which "examine[s] how our trust is being breached and abused, how we are used for rent-seeking, how governments impoverish us through the use of Monetary Nationalism and examining whether Bitcoin is the solution to restore individual freedom and limit the reach of government."

We talk about the importance of sound money, Karo and Mario's bitcoin origin stories, and whether it's better to speak out on twitter or HODL anonymously and enjoy a margarita on the beach.
