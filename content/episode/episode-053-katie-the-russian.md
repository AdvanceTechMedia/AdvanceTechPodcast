This episode features [Katie the Russian](https://twitter.com/KatieTheRussian)  a competitive sailor, proponent of self-sovereignty, flag theory, opting-out, and fellow member of the Bitcoin Toxic Ladies. We cover the right of the individual to be self-sovereign, guns and self-defense and cultivating a culture of strength and resilience. Katie introduces her new app [Kvell](https://kvell.app/) available for [preview](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kvell-app/id1520267452) and shares the story of her early start in competitive sailing.

We discuss finding your tribe and censorship free alternative media platforms such as Flote and Rumble. Anarchapulco, open source data and the dangers of blindly believing in authority without having the ability to question sources. In closing, Katie encourages you to find your confidence and believe in your ability and learn to do your own research. Sage advice.

Reach Katie on twitter at [Katie the Russian](https://twitter.com/KatieTheRussian) for expert guidance on flag theory, self-defense, resilience and self-sovereignty. You can preview the [Kvell app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kvell-app/id1520267452) and find out more about it [here](https://kvell.app/).
