This episode features [Katie the Russian](https://twitter.com/KatieTheRussian) one of the Bitcoin Toxic Ladies, a competitive sailor, proponent of self-sovereignty, flag theory, and opting-out.

We cover the right of the individual to be self-sovereign, guns and self-defense and cultivating a culture of strength and resilience. Katie introduces her new app Kvell available on [app stores at] and talks about her early start in competitive sailing.

We discuss finding your tribe and censorship free alternative media platforms such as Flote and Rumble. Anarchapulco open source data and the dangers of blindly believing in authority without having the ability to question sources.

In closing, Katie encourages you to find your confidence and believe in your ability and learn to do your own research. Sage advice.

You can reach Katie on twitter at [Katie the Russian](https://twitter.com/KatieTheRussian) and find out more about Kvell at
