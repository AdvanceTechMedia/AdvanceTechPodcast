Written by Alexandra Moxin

**"Never. Stop. Building." Rick, President of CryptoCloaks**

CryptoCloaks LLC was born from the love of 3D printing and the idea of Bitcoin. Their passion for 3D design sparked in December of 2017 with their first product, a Ledger Nano S mount. This product allowed them to safely and securely keep the Ledger hidden.  After the success from this mount they quickly grew. Their highly sought after products have shipped to the United States, Japan, Austrailia, Germany, Mexico, Canada, China, Switzerland, UK, France, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Ireland, Czech Republic, Reunion, The Netherlands, Thailand, Lativa, Poland, Israel, and Spain.

In this episode we discuss how Rick got started in 3D printing, his bitcoin origin story, trends, character, getting started with the Lightning Network, running a full node, services to help you get there and communities you can join.
