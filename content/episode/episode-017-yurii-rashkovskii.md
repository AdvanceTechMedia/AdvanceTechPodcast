Yurii Rashkovskii is a Software Developer, Entrepreneur and Blockchain expert. He's passionate about edge computing (aka true serverless) and creating free and open solutions that liberate us from vendor lock-ins. He's recently released SIT: Serverless Information Tracker.

Yurii has been around Bitcoin and Blockchain since 2012 and has previously co-founded two startups in the space, and is looking forward to participating in thoughtful initiatives and projects in the future.

He has contributed to a number of open source projects such as Elixir, erlzmq2, NixOS, GraphQL Java and a number of smaller libraries for Rust, Java, JavaScript, Erlang, Elixir and Ruby. He has a bunch of interesting ideas in the pipeline and is committing his time and resources to furthering the exploration of new and old but forgotten ideas at Etcetera Labs.

Look for Yurii at upcoming conferences and talks (to be announced)!
