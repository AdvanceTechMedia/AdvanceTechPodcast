Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Samson Mow at the Blockstream office in Victoria, B.C., Canada. Samson is CSO at Blockstream, CEO at Pixelmatic and 25 percent of the Magical Crypto Friends. We discuss Samson's background in the game industry and how he got into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space. We cover a wide range of topics including Samson's motivation for joining Blockstream, along with some of the company's core values and offerings including Liquid and Blockstream Satellite.

We talk a little about emerging trends in the space, what you may expect to see in 2019 and why Bitcoin is the gold standard in the cryptocurrency space. We talk about how the Magical Crypto Friends show started and what's next and touch on the upcoming Magical Crypto Conference, May 11 and 12 in New York City.

I ask Samson about what his team is working on at Pixelmatic and the upcoming MMO RTS game Infinite Fleet and what its like balancing a dual leadership role. Samson gives a bit of insight into his line of hats including an upcoming design listeners can soon purchase at the [Blockstream Store](https://store.blockstream.com/). We talk about the ICE Data Services V3 announcement and the video [A Million Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBCVMwQpsXQ) celebrating Bitcoin's 10th Birthday. In closing comments to our listeners, Samson asks what do you think money is and is it your money if you cannot truly control it.

You can find and follow Samson on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Excellion) and meet him in person at the upcoming [Magical Crypto Conference](https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/) this May 11 and 12 in NYC!

Hope you enjoy this episode!
