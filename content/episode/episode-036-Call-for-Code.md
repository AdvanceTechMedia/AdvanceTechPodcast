Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Daniel Krook, CTO for IBM's Code and Response and Call for Code. We talk about Call for Code and the Code and Response programs, what's new for 2020 and how you can get involved. This year Call for Code is running two tracks: one geared toward identifying and deploying solutions for the current COVID-19 pandemic and the second addresses climate change. Solutions found in the COVID-19 track will be rapidly deployed using IBM's existing Code and Response infrastructure. 

You don't need to be a developer to participate. To find out more and to sign up, go to [Call for Code.org](https://callforcode.org/). The world is facing major challenges on multiple fronts and now more than ever we need your help. Will you answer the call?
