Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend time with Peter McCormack, Founder and Host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Defiance podcast and Defiance TV. Covering everything from Bitcoin, film making, his ongoing legal battle, early forays as a hip hop artist, film critic and other creative endeavours. We go fairly in depth into his human interest recordings including interviews with Lyn Ulbricht telling Ross's story, and an upcoming documentary film with the band Ghost Inside.

As often happens, when you get two people together who are used to asking the questions, it turns into more of a conversation. We go into how we've each coped with the lockdown, unexpected interests and things not commonly known along with what's on the horizon for Peter in 2020 and beyond.

You can reach Peter on [twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack) or by [email](mailto:hello@whatbitcoindid.com) You can listen to episodes and find more about his shows at [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/), [Defiance Podcast](https://www.defiance.news/) and [Defiance TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7Zb9yHDHdjqcdYQUvxUGA).

Tune in to find out what Peter is up to next!
