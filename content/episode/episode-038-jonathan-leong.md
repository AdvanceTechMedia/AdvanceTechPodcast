Jonathan Leong is CEO and Co-founder of BTSE (bit-sie). BTSE is a financial tech company that uses bitcoin and other blockchain technologies to build real world products. Services include the BTSE Exchange, OTC platform, lending, asset management and the upcoming BTSE debit card. In 2020 BTSE will release a multicurrency OTC dashboard for buy and sell orders across all fiat and crypto trading paths and later this year will add more spot and futures listings and more fiat gateways for easier onboarding. 

In this episode I ask Jonathan about his background and goal to build the next-generation fintech ecosystem, what interested him in bitcoin and why he believes it will become a household name. We discuss the recent launch of the BTSE token and decision to launch on the Liquid Network. BTSE are members are the Liquid Federation and have partnerships with Blockstream, Brave New Coin any many other partners behind the scenes.
