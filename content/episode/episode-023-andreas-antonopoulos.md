Written by Alexandra Moxin

"Often the truth itself is a revolutionary act" Andreas M. Antonopoulos (inspired by George Orwell)

If you're involved in Bitcoin or open blockchain projects in any way our next guest needs no introduction. In this episode we spend some time with best-selling author, speaker, educator, and one of the worldâ€™s foremost Bitcoin and open blockchain experts Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Andreas speaks about his academic and programming background and inspiration by cypherpunk philosophy, applications of cryptography and how he got into Bitcoin.



and his latest book Mastering Ethereum.

Andreas has two closing thoughts for listeners: take this opportunity to develop your skills and instead of buying cryptocurrency, think about earning it. We delve a little more into some of the things that make Bitcoin a fascinating open source project and where Bitcoin may be going.

to Andreas' goal for 2019: delivering hiqh quality, neutral education to as many people as possible in as many languages as possible. Andreas has a keen eye for world changing technology, sit back and hope you enjoy our conversation!

A big thank you to Seattle Technical College and SeaGL for lending us space for this interview!
