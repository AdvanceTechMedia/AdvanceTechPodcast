Written by Alexandra Moxin

"[Often] the truth [itself] is a revolutionary act" George Orwell, 1984

If you're involved in Bitcoin or open blockchain projects in any way our next guest needs no introduction. In this episode we spend some time with best-selling author, speaker, educator, and one of the worldâ€™s foremost Bitcoin and open blockchain experts Andreas M. Antonopoulos. Andreas speaks about his academic and programming background and inspiration through cypherpunk philosophy, applications of cryptography and how he got into Bitcoin.

We cover a wide swath of all the things which make Bitcoin interesting including its principles and the revolutionary technology behind it. We delve into some of Andreas' talks, what makes Bitcoin a fascinating open source project and where Bitcoin may be going. We discuss his latest book Mastering Ethereum and the process behind writing his latest of two O'Reilly books.

Andreas has spoken in front of audiences at every major Bitcoin conference and senate and finance committees around the world; expect to see him delivering his message at more mainstream developer conferences in 2019. Andreas' goal for 2019 is delivering hiqh quality, neutral education to as many people as possible in as many languages as possible.

Andreas has two closing thoughts for listeners: recognize the enormous opportunity in front of you and take this opportunity to develop your skills in this space and, instead of buying cryptocurrency, think about earning it. Andreas has a keen eye for world changing technology, sit back and hope you enjoy our conversation!

A big thank you to Seattle Technical College and SeaGL for lending us space for this interview!
