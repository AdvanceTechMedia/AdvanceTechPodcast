Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Ivan Beschastnikh, post Doc Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia and co-Author of the Erlay paper. Erlay is a scaling proposal relevant to Bitcoin, proposing changes to the way transactions are disseminated.

We also discuss Biscotti, a distributed machine learning system.

Closing out the episode Ivan asks listeners

Enjoy!
