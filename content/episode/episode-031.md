Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Adam Back a Cypherpunk, Applied Cryptographer, the Inventor of Hashcash, co-founder and CEO of [Blockstream](http://blockstream.com).

We cover Adam's background, what sparked his interest in Computer Science and cryptography and how he got started. As one of the 10 people whose research is directly cited in the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://www.lopp.net/pdf/bitcoin.pdf), it seemed appropriate to ask him how he would describe Bitcoin and what he considers its fundamental strengths.

I ask about the areas of research he is most excited about and we delve into Schnorr signatures, taproot and graftroot and how these improvements could be implemented in Bitcoin. We discuss the recent Binance hack and the talk of a re-org to recover the funds and go into detail around why Bitcoin re-orgs are a bad idea.

In closing I ask him what are the core tenants of being a cypherpunk and questions he has for our listeners. You can find and follow Adam on [twitter](https://twitter.com/adam3us) reach out to him with ideas on applied cryptography, use cases, design and UX improvement suggestions for Bitcoin and find out more about [Blockstream](http://blockstream.com).

Hope you enjoy this episode!
