Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode we interview Roman Snitko, CTO of HODL HODL and co-organizer of the Baltic Honeybadger conference held annually in Riga, Latvia. We ask Roman about his background and how he got into Bitcoin. Roman gives us insight into how HODL HODL was created, some of the features and what users can expect with the multisig P2P cryptocurrency exchange that doesn't hold funds. You'll also hear a little more about the HODL HODL Prediction Contracts feature announced at Baltic Honeybadger.

We spend some time talking about Baltic Honeybadger and what you can look forward to next year. We also touch on decentralization and regulation and why over-regulation is a slippery slope in terms of privacy and innovation.

Hope you enjoy this episode!
