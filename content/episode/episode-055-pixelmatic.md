<i>"In traditional, online multiplayer games, players spend hours and hours building, in our case, spaceships and [unique game assets]. In Infinite Fleet you'll be rewarded with INF by taking part in these big events ... and with that currency, you're able to trade peer to peer digital items that you've built."</i> Chris Wood

This episode features Chris Wood, Chief Operating Officer at Pixelmatic, creators of Infinite Fleet their new MMO video game. I ask Chris what it's like being COO, and what it's like working for Samson :-)

We discuss where Pixelmatic is at with game and story development of Infinite Fleet and what features gamers can expect to see. We delve into the in-game Bitcoin backed cryptocurrency INF which will be available throughout gameplay, and the NFT game assets, both issued on Liquid.

I ask Chris about Bitcoin, what excites and keeps him in the space, dollar cost averaging and why its important to stay humble. We talk about what the day to day is like at Pixelmatic, challenges and pivots. We go in depth about the INF in-game token issued on Liquid, the raise in the EU via stokr.io and raise in the US.

To close out the episode I ask Chris if he has any questions for the audience, and he's curious what people think about NFTs.
