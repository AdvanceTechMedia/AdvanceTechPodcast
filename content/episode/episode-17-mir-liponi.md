Written by Alexandra Moxin

Joining me today is Mir Liponi aka Mir_BTC. Mir is CEO of Satoshi Design, a partner company of Bitcoin Valley, and a cypherpunk. Discovering bitcoin in 2012 Mir has contributed to many important bitcoin projects through BHB Network GmbH and Blockchain Labit and has given talks at Baltic Honeybadger, Understanding Bitcoin and Unconfiscatable. She is also one of the organizers of the Bitcoin Milano Meetup.

Based in Milan, Mir gives a personal account how she and her family have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic, surviving while maintaining personal liberty and how could the situation could have been handled better. At the start of the episode we discuss how Mir found bitcoin, and how she has contributed to the space.
