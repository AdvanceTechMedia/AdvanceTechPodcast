Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend time with Smuggler and Frank Braun live from the 7th Annual Hackers Congress: Digital Totality at Paralelni Polis in Prague, CZ. Both guests are cryptoanarchists, software developers and advocates for privacy. They co-founded TAZ0 and co-host the Cypherpunk Bitstream Podcast.

In this episode we talk about Paralelni Polis and how you can support this inspiring place and we explore why privacy is important.

Tune in next episode for part two where we go in depth on what steps you can take to protect your privacy and dig into Frank and Smuggler's backgrounds, the talks each gave at HCPP, and what they're working on.


You can reach this episode's guests on twitter at [@The Real Smuggler](https://twitter.com/therealsmuggler?lang=en) and [@Frank Braun](https://twitter.com/thefrankbraun).

<b> Tune in mid-January for part 2!</b>
