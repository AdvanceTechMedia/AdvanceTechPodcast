Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend time with Rodolfo, CEO of Coinkite: makers of bitcoin hardware products. Coinkite has four main products enabling the ability to use bitcoin securely and privately. Opendime which is a bitcoin bearer bond, Coldcard one of the most private and secure bitcoin wallets, BlockClock created in 2019 to celebrate the first ten years of bitcoin and Coldpower a new device enabling data isolation for USB power for your Coldcard. 

We talk about the pandemic and how things have changed before getting into Rodolfo’s bitcoin origin story. We cover bitcoin fundamentals, the impracticality of attempting a 51% attack on bitcoin vs. other protocols and Rodolfo’s thoughts on new and interesting developments coming to bitcoin including Schnorr, Taproot and the Square grant. We touch on smart contracts and tokens on bitcoin sidechains like the Liquid Network vs. other protocols. 

Closing out the show I ask Rodolfo about amateur radio, why he got into it and how you can get involved. We also discuss carnivory and why privacy is important.

You can reach Rodolfo on twitter [@ NVK](https://twitter.com/nvk) or via the [Coldcard telegram channel](https://t.me/coldcard). If you’re curious about amateur radio reach the VHF Toronto tower and look up V83TOX.
