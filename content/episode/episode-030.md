Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Mari Galloway, CEO and Founding Board Member of the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu (WSC). The WSC is one of the fastest growing 501c3 non-profit cybersecurity communities dedicated to bringing more women and girls to cyber and provides women with the resources and support required to enter and advance as a cybersecurity professional.

We talk about Mari's background and how she got started in the industry and go over and how the WSC helps empower and foster the development of Women in Cyber. Mari highlights some of the WSC's significant accomplishments including the Cyberjutsu awards, expanding the organization to reach a wider membership and the Cyberjutsu Girls Academy. Mari reviews the organization's mandate, how you can support and join the WSC, the She Speaks Tech series and tangible ways you can grow your career.

You'll also hear a preview of what you can expect at the Wicked 6 Cyber Games this summer including how you can participate and support the event as a sponsor. If you're looking to grow your team this is a great opportunity to get the word out and connect with some amazing candidates. Immediately following the Wicked 6 Cyber Games is the 6th Annual Cyberjutsu Awards dinner.

Listen in around minute 28:00 to learn tangible ways you can grow your skills as a speaker and begin to speak at more conferences, and tune in around 34:30 to hear Mari's questions for our audience.

You can follow Mari on [twitter](https://twitter.com/marigalloway), connect with her on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/themarigalloway/) and find out more about the [WSC](https://womenscyberjutsu.org/) and the upcoming [Wicked 6 Cyber Games](https://wicked6.com/) on August 8, 2019 held in Las Vegas at the Luxor between Black Hat USA 2019 and DEFCON 27.

Hope you enjoy this episode!
