In this episode I spend some time with Mari Galloway, CEO and Founding Board Member of the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu (WSC). The WSC is one of the fastest growing 501c3 non-profit cybersecurity communities dedicated to bringing more women and girls to cyber and provides women with the resources and support required to enter and advance as a cybersecurity professional.
