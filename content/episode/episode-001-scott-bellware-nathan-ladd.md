On the inaugural episode of the Advance Tech Podcast we interview special guests Scott Bellware and Nathan Ladd, microservices and distributed systems experts out of Austin, Texas.

[Scott Bellware](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottbellware/) [@sbellware](https://twitter.com/sbellware) works with development teams on monolith and Rails remediation, and autonomous services projects. He’s been on a five-year mission to incorporate all the good things he’s learned in the distributed systems world with all the good things he’s learned in the Ruby world. He's been coding professionally for twenty-five years, held every position in a software organization from QA to CTO, and worked in a variety of languages, frameworks, and platforms. Scott is a contributor to the Eventide toolkit for event-sourced autonomous services in Ruby.

[Nathan Ladd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-ladd-76440b21/) [@realntl](https://twitter.com/realntl) has been writing software professionally for over 10 years, specializing in domain driven design, architecture, and systems engineering. His languages include Ruby, C, and Javascript, and has recently worked extensively with service oriented architecture and event sourcing in Ruby. Nathan is also a contributor to the Eventide project.

### Some of the things we cover in this episode

* The two definitions of “microservices” one of science, and one of conjecture
    * One comes from web developers who see the world through MVC and APIs
    * One comes from people with prior experience in service architectures
* A common mistake that web developers make is not arriving at service autonomy
* Rule #1 of services - you can’t query data from services
* How ORMs cause monoliths
