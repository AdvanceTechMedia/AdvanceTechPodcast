Written by Alexandra Moxin

This episode features Sodomák, Co Founder of Paralelni Polis, a nonprofit organization providing education in the area of digital freedom, and Josef, Manager of Bordel, a small community hackerspace located in the basement of Paralelní Polis. This episode was recorded live, so the audio isn't perfect, but the episode was too good not to share.

We discuss the founding of Paralelni Polis and Bordel Hackerspace, the Annual Hackers Congress #HCPP, and current projects. Find out how you can support and get involved with [Paralelni Polis](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/) and [Bordel Hackerspace](https://bordel.paralelnipolis.cz/#/), the upcoming [Hackers Congress @ Paralelni Polis #HCPP21 - Chaos](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/koncepty/hcpp/) and [Hackatoshi's Flying Circuit](https://flyingcircuit.com/#/).
