Written by Alexandra Moxin

This episode features Jennifer Robertson, Sales and Marketing Lead and Co-Founder of Qwasar Silicon Valley, a coding school with locations in Silicon Valley, Seattle and other satellite locations around the world. 

Qwasar Silicon Valley is a global leader in innovative, skills-based learning, and tech talent development. Built by experts with 20+ years of experience, they are building a community of learners and recruiters to fuel digital transformation and talent for the digital economy.

Qwasar, was co-founded by the founders of Ecole 42, and trains people for roles in the digital economy. They offer skills based training in software engineering, full stack development, data science, cloud & devops engineering, and AI & machine learning. 

Jennifer shares two (anonymous) stories of prior students, one who landed a position in data science at Tesla, and one who now works in front end development at Cap Gemini. She goes over how you can engage with the programs, the timing, and frequency of each cohort.

I ask Jennifer how the Seattle tech scene compares to the tech environment in Silicon Valley - and she provides great insight on what makes each place unique. Qwasar's mission is to train millions for the digital world and to make that accessible. Find out how you can support, learn, and get involved at [Qwasar.io](https://qwasar.io/).
