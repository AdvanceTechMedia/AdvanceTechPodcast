Live from the [Linux Foundation Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2018/) we spend some time with [John Walicki](https://advancetechmedia.org/guest/#John_Walicki) and [Animesh Singh](https://advancetechmedia.org/guest/#Animesh_Singh) from IBM and [Trevor Riggen](https://advancetechmedia.org/guest/#Trevor_Riggen) from the American Red Cross in part one of a three part series. Guests John Walicki, Watson IoT Developer Ecosystem Advocate and Animesh Singh, STSM and Program Director - Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Platform share a few insights on how IBM is innovating. In the first part of the episode we talk about Call for Code and how IBM is innovating in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We also dig into the rich mathematics background of IBM Research and each of our guests backgrounds and experience with IBM. In the last part of this episode I talk in depth with Trevor Riggen, the American Red Cross Regional Executive for the Northern California Coastal Region about [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) and dig in to some of the hard facts about emergency response sitations and disaster scenarios.
