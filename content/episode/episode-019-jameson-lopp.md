Description = "Dr. Richard Matthew Stallman is a software developer and software freedom activist. He worked at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT from 1971 to 1984, learning operating system development and wrote the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1976. He also developed the AI technique of dependency-directed backtracking, known as truth maintenance. In 1983 Stallman announced the project to develop the GNU operating system, a Unix-like operating system meant to be entirely free software, and has been the leader of the project ever since. With that announcement he also launched the Free Software Movement. Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, is the main author of the GNU General Public License and gives speeches frequently about free software and related topics.
