Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Adron Hall, software architect, engineer, coder, distributed systems advocate and Developer Advocate at DataStax. We cover Adron's background, what he does at DataStax and the story behind how he joined the team. We talk about Thrashing Code and some of the unconventional benefits he's learned from Twitch streaming and we dig into his talk and experience at DevOps Days in Vancouver.

Adron is very active in the Seattle and Portland tech communities and along with running two very successful meetups he talks about organizing .NET Fringe, Node PDX and what you can expect at the upcoming artificial intelligence / machine learning conference [ML 4 All](http://ml4all.org/).

Toward the end of the episode, we go pretty in depth about Twitch, YouTube and self-hosted creative content, AI fairness and addressing the problem of bias in machine learning data sets, and Adron's community advocacy and policy work. You can find Adron on [twitter](https://twitter.com/adron) at the upcoming [ML4ALL](http://ml4all.org/) conference and on his blog [Composite Code](https://compositecode.blog/).

We experienced a number of humourous technical difficulties - stay tuned for these at the end of the episode (after the outro music).

Hope you enjoy this episode!
