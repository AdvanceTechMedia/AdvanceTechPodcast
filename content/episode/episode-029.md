Written by Alexandra Moxin

In this episode I spend some time with Adron Hall, software architect, engineer, coder, distributed systems advocate and Developer Advocate at DataStax.


Adron Hall is a principal engineer and systems architect. He runs the gamut of dev stacks from Ruby on Rails, Golang, Node.js and .NET, but a favorite of his these days is Go combined with a growing admiration for the chaos of JavaScript. As a software architect, engineer, or coder (depending on your preference of title wording), Adron is fluent in test-driven and behavior-driven development and passionate about DevOps. In his free time, he is involved with hackathons, user groups, and other tech community events.

Adron is often referred to as the “guy with solutions”. If there’s a question about how something should be built, he is the go to guy for coming up with how to get things done, deployed, and into production. With his calm and collected demeanor, and sometimes snarky wit, Adron is the person you want building teams and creating systems. His ability to impart upon others energy, knowledge, and enthusiasm is exceptional.

You can find Adron on [twitter](https://twitter.com/adron) and on his blog [Composite Code](https://compositecode.blog/).

Hope you enjoy this episode!
