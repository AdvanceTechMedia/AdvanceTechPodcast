iComply ICO streamlines legal, due diligence and accounting processes providing automated checks and balances throughout the issuance, purchase and resale of encrypted digital share certificates.

Matthew is passionate about unlocking the opportunities that new technology has to offer us, and future generations. Along with his mandate at iComply ICO, Matthew worked with financial services, government, small businesses, and nonprofits to identify ways to better use their technology to create sustainable and ethical automation.

Matthew's team is releasing the whitelabel of their product for the end of January 2018 and a beta of their platform for private equity markets by end of Q1 2018. Their full platform, which will be able to compete directly on compliance with publically traded markets, will be released later this year.
