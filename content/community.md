[**Bitko Yinowsky**](https://bitko.cc/) was Born not quite so long ago, in a tucked away corner of the Internet somewhere in the Eastern European hinterland. Like in the case of many youngsters, efforts to control him are pretty much all in vain. His decentralized nature, limited supply, ability to thrive under adversarial conditions, as well as his insatiable appetite for all the fiat money printed out of thin air, scare the living daylights out of authorities. Follow him on his adventurous graphical journey as he gobbles up copious amounts of fiat and levels out the financial playground for all on the planet.

<img src="/img/guest/cryptograffiti.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>

[**cryptograffiti**](https://cryptograffiti.com/) is a Bitcoin activist artist.  His work is dedicated to spreading a grassroots movement with the ability to change the world for the better. He sees Bitcoin as a necessary alternative to our broken financial system.  Beyond finance, he believes separating money from state is one of the most crucial steps we can take for humanity in an increasingly Orwellian society. Art has the ability to distill complex subject matter into something more people can understand.  This is especially important with Bitcoin as those who stand to benefit from it the most are likely to learn about it last. By repurposing banking materials in his work, he hopes to teach others about the importance of this movement vs the status quo.

Event Modeling minimizes the amount of rework by working off of a blueprint that can be created in a very short time compared to existing design and modeling methodologies.
