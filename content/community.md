The new [SingularityNET Forum](https://community.singularitynet.io/about) is a civilized place for public discussion to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation. Participants are encouraged to move the discussion forward by contributing to and engaging in reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation. The SingularityNET platform enables multiple AI computing agents to work as a whole to provide various services in a distributed and decentralized way.

[Bitcoin-N-Beers](https://www.bitcoinandbeers.com/) is a volunteer run group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We meet to learn about cryptocurrency, blockchain and decentralized technology in comfortable low-key settings. You don't have to be a technophile, a crypto trader, or understand blockchain to join us. It's for experts and newbies in the community alike.

[Jameson Lopp's Bitcoin Resources](https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html) is one of the most comprehensive sources about Bitcoin you'll find on the web and is grounded in knowledge and sound principles. Bitcoin is a revolutionary system which levels the playing field but it's not easy to understand without putting in a little time. Jameson encourages you to make sure you have a decent grasp of the system before you store a significant amount of value in it.
